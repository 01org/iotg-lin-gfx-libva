#Libva Project

Libva is an implementation for VA-API (Video Acceleration API)

VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which
provides access to graphics hardware acceleration capabilities
for video processing. It consists of a main library and
driver-specific acceleration backends for each supported hardware 
vendor.

We also recommend taking a look at the ['janitorial'
bugs](https://github.com/01org/libva/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AJanitorial)
in our list of open issues as these bugs can be solved without an
extensive knowledge of libva.

We would love to help you start contributing!
